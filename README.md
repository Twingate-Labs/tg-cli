[!Work In Progress!]

This is a command line application demonstrating various usages of the Twingate API.


**Setup**
1. Obtain an API key from the Twingate Admin Console with at least read and write permissions
2. Install [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation) for your platform.
3. At the terminal execute ``./tg.js``.

**Compilation**

*Note, waiting on the [following](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/12086) GitHub issue to be fixed and released before compilation will work - affecting versions up until 1.16.4.*


This script can be compiled to a native executable binary using `deno compile --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run --unstable ./tg.js`

Thereafter you can execute the binary without deno: ``./tg --help``

**Example - Show command usage**

``./tg.js --help``

``./tg.js group --help``

**Example - Export Excel file**

``./tg.js export``

**Example - Export PNG image**

``./tg.js export --format png``

*Note: Requires the [GraphViz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io) package to be [installed](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/#executable-packages) and available on your path.*

**Example - List resources**

``./tg.js resource list``


**Example - Import Groups, Remote Networks and resources into a new account**

``./tg.js import -a [new account name] -nrg -f [path to file to import from (format must be as outputted by the export command)]``
